# Web Stock Tracker
This is a stock-tracker I made with [React Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/docs/react-charts/) and the [Finnhub API](http://finnhub.io/). 

I wanted to learn about data visualization, so I figured this would be a good experiment to learn with. You can [try out the web app](https://wkedx.csb.app/) if you'd like :-)
